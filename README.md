# 🌟 Random Quote Generator

This is a basic JavaScript project that displays random quotes on a webpage. It’s a beginner-friendly exercise focused on practicing DOM manipulation and building interactive user interfaces.

## 📌 What is JavaScript (JS)?

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language used to make web pages dynamic and interactive. It runs in the browser and enables features like form validation, interactive maps, content updates without page reload, and much more.

## 🌐 What is DOM Manipulation?

The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects. DOM manipulation means using JavaScript to access, modify, add, or remove elements on a web page — like changing text, showing/hiding items, or responding to user input.

## 💬 What is a Quote Generator?

A quote generator is a simple application that displays a random quote each time a user clicks a button. It's great for practicing conditional logic, array handling, and DOM updates with JavaScript.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone this repository and open `index.html` in your browser. Click the button to generate a new quote every time.
